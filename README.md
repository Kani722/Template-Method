Template Method Design Pattern Example
This repository demonstrates the Template Method Design Pattern in Java. The Template Method Design Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing its structure.

Overview
The main class Main demonstrates the use of the Template Method design pattern. The pattern is implemented by creating an abstract class CaffeineBeverage that outlines the steps required to prepare a beverage. The concrete classes Tea and Coffee extend CaffeineBeverage and provide specific implementations for the brewing and condiment addition steps.

Classes
CaffeineBeverage: An abstract class with a prepareRecipe method that defines the algorithm for making a beverage. It includes methods for common steps (boilWater, pourInCup) and abstract methods (brew, addCondiments) for subclass-specific steps.

Tea: A subclass of CaffeineBeverage that implements the brew and addCondiments methods to prepare tea.

Coffee: A subclass of CaffeineBeverage that implements the brew and addCondiments methods to prepare coffee.

Main Class: The Main class contains the main method, which demonstrates the following:

Creating a Tea object and calling its prepareRecipe method to make tea.
Creating a Coffee object and calling its prepareRecipe method to make coffee.
How the Template Method Pattern Works
The CaffeineBeverage class defines the prepareRecipe method, which outlines the steps for making a beverage:

Boil water - This step is common for all beverages and is defined in the CaffeineBeverage class.
Brew - This is a subclass-specific step, implemented in Tea and Coffee.
Pour in cup - This step is also common and is defined in the CaffeineBeverage class.
Add condiments - This is another subclass-specific step, implemented in Tea and Coffee.
By calling prepareRecipe, the CaffeineBeverage class ensures that the algorithm steps are followed in the correct order, while allowing subclasses to customize certain parts of the process.

Conclusion
The Template Method Design Pattern allows for code reuse and a structured approach to defining algorithms where specific steps can be customized by subclasses. In this example, the CaffeineBeverage class ensures that the beverage preparation process is consistent, while allowing Tea and Coffee to define their own unique steps for brewing and adding condiments.
